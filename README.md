# Convex Symmetry
This is a program to compute the axial symmetry of convex polygons. It can be used for exact checks, but it also has an efficient quick check which makes it capable of running a reasonably strong search for low symmetry shapes using [simulated annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing). There is a more detailed explanation of its purpose on [my personal website](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~kjmoore/axiality.html).

Download [JDK 19](http://jdk.java.net/) for your operating system. Make sure `JAVA_HOME` is properly set to the JDK installation directory.
